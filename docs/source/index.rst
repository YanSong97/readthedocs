======================================================================

**Light-MALib** is a Pythonic framework for Population-Based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PB-MARL). As the name suggests, L-MALib is a
simplified version of the `MALib <https://github.com/sjtu-marl/malib>`_ codebase which uses `Ray <https://www.ray.io/>`_ as a backend. L-MALib follows the design of an Actor-based RL systems which execute algorithms through message passing between a set of actors deployed on worker node.
